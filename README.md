# Wifi Speed Watcher

A little program I designed to continuously monitor and record your WiFi speed over time and then present the data in a graph.


## TODO
- [ ] Add CLI params (Options to set the port for the dashboard and to set the interval that the wifi speed is recorded at)
- [ ] Maybe release builds at https://github.com/nekoify/wifi-speed-watcher/releases
